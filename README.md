Project Details

Project Overview
This project is a full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It includes user authentication (signup, login, logout), password reset functionality, and email notifications using NodeMailer.
Backend (Express.js with Node.js)
Key Features
1.	User Registration (Signup)
o	Endpoint: /auth/signup
o	Functionality: Allows users to create a new account by providing a username, email, and password. The password is hashed using bcrypt for security.
o	Additional Feature: Sends a registration confirmation email to the user's email address.
2.	User Login
o	Endpoint: /auth/login
o	Functionality: Allows registered users to log in by providing their email and password. A JWT token is generated and stored in an HTTP-only cookie for session management.
3.	Password Reset
o	Endpoint: /auth/forgot-password
o	Functionality: Allows users to request a password reset by providing their email. A reset token is generated and sent to the user's email address with a link to reset their password.
o	Endpoint: /auth/reset-password/:token
o	Functionality: Allows users to reset their password using the token received in the email.
4.	User Logout
o	Endpoint: /auth/logout
o	Functionality: Clears the authentication token stored in the cookies, effectively logging out the user.
5.	Fetch Users
o	Endpoint: /auth/getUsers
o	Functionality: Retrieves a list of all registered users from the database.

How It All Ties Together
•	Express.js and MongoDB: Handle user data storage, authentication, and password management on the server-side.
•	React.js: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application.
•	JWT: Ensures secure communication between the client and server by providing token-based authentication.
•	NodeMailer: Manages email notifications for user registration and password resets.
Future Enhancements
1.	Profile Management: Allow users to update their profile information.
2.	Enhanced Security: Implement additional security measures like account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
3.	Responsive Design: Improve the UI to be fully responsive for various devices.
4.	Role-Based Access Control: Implement roles like admin and user with different access levels.
This project provides a solid foundation for building a secure and user-friendly web application with essential user authentication and management features.
